    <!-- QUE1.  difference between == and === -->
    <!-- === => strict equality
    == => loose equality -->
    <!-- 1.Both are the camparison operator they return boolean value
    2.In == that that is used to compare only value 
    3.Where as === is used to campare the value and datatype -->
    <!-- Eg. var x="1234"
        var y=1234
        (x==y) =>True
  if we gave,
        (x===y) =>False -->

<!-- QUE2.What is spread operator? -->
<!-- The javascript spread operator (...) allows us to destructure the non-Primitive data types like arrays and objects to access the elements individually.

Rest Operatpr
The javascript spread operator (...) allows us to structure the non-Primitive data types like arrays and objects to access the elements individually. -->

<!-- Que3. Difference between var, let and const.
var => var is a global scoped means variable created using var keyword will be accessible globally it can be redeclared and reinitialized.

let => let is a blocked scoped means variable created using let keyword will be accessible only in that specicific block where it has been declared It cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.

const => Const is a block scoped means variable created using const keyword will be accissible only specific block. It cannot be redeclared or reinitialized. -->

<!-- QUE3.What is execution context?
Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,
Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.
JS engine uses a Call stack and also creates a special environment to handle the execution of
the JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in
its execution.
During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables
and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets
executed.
There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
● Global Execution Context (GEC)
● Function Execution Context (FEC -->

<!-- The moment code gets executed GEC gets created and gets pushed to Call Stack. Inside the
global or functional execution context, there are two phases : Memory allocation (Creation
Phase) and Code execution (Execution Phase).
Inside Memory allocation, the variables declared using var keyword get memory allocated as
undefined in global scope and variables declared using let or const gets their memory allocated
as undefined in block scope. -->

<!--QUE4. WHAT IS MEANT BY FIRST CLSS FUNCTION -->
<!-- A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language
are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as
an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a
value to a variable. -->
